# SuperWiki
## About
The SuperWiki is a database of everything Marvel that lets users build an online collection of their favorites comics. It also has a page commemorating Marvel creators and actors who have passed away.

Users can create an account and log in to the app to view comics pulled from the API and mark them as favorites, to be added to their Favorite collection.

## Tech Used
Superwiki is a React app that pulls information from the offical Marvel API (https://developer.marvel.com/), including comic thumbnails, titles, release dates, and more. Calls to the Marvel API and MondoDB (for user login/signup) are done using Axios.

For styling, the site uses Bootstrap and the Sketchy theme from Bootswatch.

## Stretch Goals
A future goal would be to include a search function- Marvel's API provides endpoints for character and storyline searching.
